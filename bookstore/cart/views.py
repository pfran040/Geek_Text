# CODE AUTHOR: RAUL ESPINOSA
# The views for the Cart. I used the Django
# documentation to learn about views:

# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/views/
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/views/

# EDIT: Don't know why, but my last push from when I was working in my branch
# didn't push either this or my forms.py file to the Development branch.
