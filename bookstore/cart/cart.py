# ====================================================================
# CODE AUTHOR: RAUL ESPINOSA
# This is the code for the actual cart functionality. A small note:
# I can't actually make the cart "work" until the models of the things
# that are supposed to go in the cart (i.e. the books) exist and can
# be imported/referenced. That being the case, I'm going to use some
# placeholder code to model the functionality needed. These can be
# refactored to the genuine book model code when it's available

# Note that I used the following resources to learn
# about django session functions and such:
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/http/sessions/
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Sessions

# This data type simplifies floating-point arithmetic and makes it
# look more like what calculators make it look like in real life.
# Also allows for rounding rules to be established,
# which will help with price calculations
