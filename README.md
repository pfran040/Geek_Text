# software_eng1_project
Software Engineer project that I was completed with a team of 5 developers over the course of 10 weeks. This repository only contains the work that I worked on and any work that is required to complete that work. I was given the comment and rating system for users wanting to review a book. A user must be signed in to review a book. This project was created by Raul Espinosa, Arturo Fernandez, Tomas Gonzales and Paul Franco

To run project:
Requires Python 3 
Install django crispy forms: pip install --upgrade django-crispy-forms
Navigate to directory that contains manage.py and run python manage.py runserver
Users can create a profile and edit their profile and must be signed in to add a book to their shopping cart, make a wishlist, and comment and rate a book for other users.
